# Packs a software Vulkan driver for the x86_64 Wine guest: the Khronos Vulkan
# loader and Mesa's lavapipe ICD, with every library they need that the x86_64
# guest libraries (tools/x86_64-guest-libs) and Android do not already provide.
#
# Why this exists: DXVK needs a Vulkan driver that can present to the app's X
# server (VK_KHR_xlib_surface / VK_KHR_xcb_surface). On an x86_64 Android device
# nothing offers one: Android's own loader has only VK_KHR_android_surface, the
# device's Mesa HAL is an Android-platform build that cannot act as a Khronos
# ICD, and Vortek/Turnip exist only for arm64. Lavapipe renders on the CPU, so it
# is slow, but it runs on every x86_64 device, BlueStacks included.
#
# The binaries are Termux's x86_64 packages (vulkan-loader-generic,
# mesa-vulkan-icd-swrast and their dependencies, from packages.termux.dev), each
# checked against the SHA-256 the repository index publishes. The approach
# (Termux's loader and lavapipe, a dependency closure, an ICD manifest written on
# the device with an absolute library path) follows Bliss-Bass/GameNative-x64
# (scripts/provision-x86_64-vulkan.sh, docs/X86_64_VULKAN_PROVISIONING.md,
# GPL-3.0). usr/share/doc/x86_64-lavapipe/PACKAGES in the archive names every
# package and version it was made from.
